FPGA-based implementation of the classic Pacman arcade game entirely in Verilog, leveraging advanced digital design concepts including novel finite state machines (FSMs) to control game logic and state transitions, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) customized for rapid computations, off-chip memory controllers to manage external RAM/ROM interactions, and specialized game and peripheral controllers (VGA, keyboard, HEX display, timer).
